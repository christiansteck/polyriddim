# Polyriddim

A PWA to improve your polyrhythm skills. Inspired by the [7:11 Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CgR2Y6XO4).

## Usage

Select the combination you want to practice and press the play button.

The default is 11 versus 7, which is quite challenging.
If you're new to this, you might want to start with e.g. 3 versus 4 or 5 versus 3.
